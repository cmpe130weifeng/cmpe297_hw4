Prototypical Networks often used for few-shot problems. It can learn distances between many classes than to learn just between two classes. I used the mini-ImageNet dataset for few-shot learning evaluation. The dataset has 100 classes with 600 samples of 84Ã—84 color images per class. These 100 classes are divided into 64, 16, and 20 classes respectively for sampling tasks for meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-test.</br>
